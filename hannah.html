	<h1>The Portal</h1>
      <div class="container">
        <p>The once was a boy name Alikid.</p>
        <p> He was a big fan of games and would always go to arcades in his free time.</p>
        <p>One day, the arcade down the street has just installed a brand new game in their building.</p>
        <p>Alakid went inside that arcade to try the game as fast as possible, he bought the coins he needed and ran towards the new game as fast as he could.</p>
        <p>"The Portal?" he questioned as he read the Title of the game. An employee saw Alakid, and told him the insctuctions, the rules, and the basics for the brand new machine.</p>
        <p>Alakid quickly understanded what he needed to do, and thank the kind employee.</p>
        <p>As he inserted his coins in the coin slot, and music started to play. The machine of the new game gave him three different cards with different numbers on the front of each of the cards.</p>
       
        <div class="card">
            <div id="num1" class="card1"></div>
            <div id="num2" class="card2"></div>
            <div id="num3" class="card3"></div>
        </div>
        
        <p>The employee said to him that these different cards leads to different games. Everytime he swipes a card on the card reader, he would be transported to another game. Alakid hesitated before he swiped a card on the card reader of the machine.</p>
        <p>The portal opened and...Alakid slowly entered through the portal.</p>
        <p>He was then transported to what is seems to be another dimension.</p>
        <p>A screen popped-up infront of him, telling him the instructions for this specific game.</p>
        <p>He understood it and close the screen by pressing the 'x' on the top right corner of the screen. He started playing the game and enjoyed it. When the game finished, a card reader popped infront of him. He swiped his card with happiness and he was transported to another game.</p>
        <p>This process repeated for a while until a screen popped-up infront of him telling him it was his final game to play and will be returned to the real world after this.</p>
        <p>Alakid was kind of sad when he read the screen, but he was more happy that he was able to enjoy the games he played. He pressed the 'x' button to removed the screen from his vision and started to play his final game.</p>
        <p>When Alakid finished his game, a white portal spawned. "I guess...it's time to leave" he said while waving goodbye to his last game.</p>
        <p>The portal transported Alakid back to the arcade, and there was a board beside the machine recording Alakid's game progress...</p><br>
